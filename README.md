## Console-Based Library Management System

This project is a comprehensive Library Management System developed in Java, utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and leveraging Java Collections for efficient data management. The system operates through a console interface, comprising two main roles: **Admin** and **Customer**.

### Features:

- **Admin Functions**:
  - Add books to the library inventory.
  - Remove books from the library inventory.
  - Manage book categories and sections.
  - View and update library catalog.

- **Customer Functions**:
  - Browse available books by category.
  - Borrow books from the library.
  - Return borrowed books.
  - Check due dates and penalties (if applicable).

### Key Concepts and Implementations:

- **Object-Oriented Design**:
  - The system is designed using OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
  - Classes like `Book`, `User`, `Library`, and `Transaction` model real-world entities and interactions within the library ecosystem.

- **Java Collections Framework**:
  - Utilization of collections such as `ArrayList`  for storing and managing book records, user data, and library transactions.
  - Efficient data retrieval and manipulation through these collections ensure scalability and performance.

### Technology Stack:

- **Language**: Java
- **Data Structures**: Java Collections (ArrayList)
- **Development Tools**: IDE (IntelliJ IDEA)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

### Future Enhancements:

- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- Adding support for user authentication and authorization.
- Incorporating a database backend for persistent data storage.
